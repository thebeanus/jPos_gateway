The `SeqNo` entity footnote:['seqno' table] is a general purpose entity 
used by jPOS-EE to store application specific sequencers.

Typical use case would be terminal-level STANS, Voucher IDs and the like.

The `SeqNoManager` supports two operating modes:

- Synchronous
- Asynchronous

In Synchronous mode, the transaction life-cycle is handled by the caller, e.g.:

[source,java]
-------------
    private long next(String id) {
        try (DB db = new DB()) {
            SeqNoManager mgr = new SeqNoManager(db);
            db.open();
            db.beginTransaction();
            long l = mgr.next(id, 999999L);
            db.commit();
            return l;
        }
    }
-------------

[NOTE]
======
In 'sync' mode, a second thread trying to obtain a sequence number will block until the
former is committed.

======

In Asynchronous mode, the JDBC connection is released and an explicit call to `SeqNoManager.release`
has to be issued, e.g.:

[source,java]
-------------
   SeqNoManager mgr = new SeqNoManager(new DB());
   long l = mgr.next("sync", id, 60000L, 60000L, 999999L);
   // ... do something, e.g.: query remote host
   mgr.release("sync", id);
   return l;
-------------

Interesting thing about async mode, is that while one calls a remote host (i.e. using `QueryHost`),
the JDBC connection gets released back to its pool.
