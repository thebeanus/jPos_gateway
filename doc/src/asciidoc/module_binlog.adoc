The jPOS BinLog has the following features:

* multiple readers and writers can be used from the same JVM
* multiple readers and writers can be used from different JVMs

[TIP]
=====
Make sure you read and understand the implementation notes at the end of this
section before you attempt to use it.

Here is a sample Writer:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    File dir = new File("/tmp/binlog");
    try (BinLogWriter bl = new BinLogWriter(dir)) {                                  <1>
        bl.add( ... ); // byte array
        bl.add( ... ); // byte array
        bl.add( ... ); // byte array
    }
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The BinLogWriter implements `AutoCloseable` so `try-with-resources` can be used

A reader would look like this:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    File dir = new File("/tmp/binlog");
    try (BinLogReader bl = new BinLogReader(dir)) {
        while (bl.hasNext()) {
            byte[] b = bl.next().get();
            // do something with the byte[]
        }
    } 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `BinLogReader` implements an `Iterator<BinLog.Entry>`. Each `BinLog.Entry` has two
main methods:

* `BinLog.Rer ref()`
* `byte[] get()`

While iterating over a BinLog, it might make sense to persistently store its `BinLog.Ref`
in order to be able to restart the iterator at a given point if required (this is useful
if using the BinLog to implement a Store and Forward).

The `BinLogReader` has two constructors:

* `BinLogReader(File dir)`
* `BinLogReader(File dir, BinLog.Ref ref)`

the latter can be used to restart the iterator at a given reference point obtained from a previous run.

In addition to the standard `hasNext()` method required by the `Iterator` implementation,
`BinLogReader` also has a `hasNext(long millis)` method that waits a given number of
milliseconds once it reaches the end of the log, attempting to wait for a new entry
to be available.


==== Implementation notes

The goal behind the BinLog implementation is to have a future proof file format easy to
read from any language, 10 years down the road. We found that the Mastercard simple IPM 
file format, that's basically a two-byte message length followed by the message itself
was suitable for that. The payload on each record can be ISO-8583 (like Mastercard), JSON,
FSDMsg based, Protocol buffers or whatever format the user choose.

But that format isn't crash proof. If a system crashes while a record is being written to
disk, the file can get easily corrupted. So we picked some ideas from Square's _tape_ 
project that implements a highly crash proof on-disk persistent circular queue using
a very small header. Tape is great and we encourage you to consider it instead of this binlog
for some use cases, but we didn't want a circular queue, we wanted a place to securely store 
events for audit or store and forward purposes, and we also wanted to be able to access the
same binlog from multiple JVMs with access to the same file-system, so we had to write our own.

The on-disk file format looks like this:

```
Format:
  256 bytes Header
  ... Data
  ... Data

Header format (256 bytes):
  4 bytes header length
  2 bytes version
  2 bytes Status (00=open, 01=closed)
  8 bytes Last element position
  4 bytes this log number
  4 bytes next log number
232 bytes reserved

Element:
  4 bytes Data length
  ...     Data

```

Each record has a length prefix (four bytes in network byte order) followed by
its data. The header has a fixed length of 256 bytes but we found useful to
make it look like a regular record too by providing its length at the very
beginning. An implementation in any language reading a jPOS binlog can just
be programmed to skip the first record.

At any given time (usually at end of day), a process can request a *cut-over*
by calling the `BinLogWriter.cutover()` method in that case, all writers and
readers will close the current file and move to the next one (Readers can
choose to not-follow to the next file, for example while producing daily
extracts).

In order to achieve file crash resilience, each write does the following:

* Lock the file
* Write the record's length and data
* Sync to disc
* Write the last element position to the header
* Sync to disc
* Unlock the file

[NOTE]
======
In an MBP with SDRAM we've managed to achieve approximately 6000 writes per
second. On an iMac with regular disk the numbers go down to approximately 1500
writes per second for regular ISO-8583 message lengths (500..1000 bytes per
record).
======

Due to the fact that the header is small enough to fit in an operating
system block, the second write where we place the last element position happens
to be atomic. While this works OK for readers and writers reading the file from
different JVMs, that's not the case for readers and writers running on the same
JVM, even if they use a different file descriptor to open the file, the operating
system stack has early access to the header that under high concurrency can lead
to garbage values, that's the reason the code synchronizes on a `mutex` object
at specific places.

==== Supporting CLI commands

The `binlog` CLI command is a subsystem that currently has three commands:

* monitor (to visually monitor a binlog)
* cutover (to force a cutover)
* exit (builtin command)

`binlog` accepts a parameter with the binlog's path, i.e: `binlog /tmp/binlog`

So a cutover can be triggered from cron using the following command:

```
q2 --command="binlog /tmp/binlog; cutover; exit; shutdown --force"
```

==== BinLog Quartz Support

The `binlog-quartz` provides support for automatic cutover, for example:

[source,xml]
------------
<cron class="org.jpos.q2.QuartzAdaptor" logger="Q2">
  <job id="1" class="org.jpos.binlog.cron.CutoverJob" when="59 59 23 * * ?"
       logger="Q2" realm="binlog-cutover">
    <property name="binlog" value="/tmp/binlog" />
  </job>
</cron>
------------
