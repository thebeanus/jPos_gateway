=== Crypto Service

The `cryptoservice` module uses AES-256 to encrypt sensitive data, such as
primary account numbers and protects the encryption key using PGP.

At start-up time, and at regular intervals, the crypto service generates a
new AES-256 key, encrypts it using PGP using one or more recipient ids (custodians),
and stores the resulting encrypted message in the sysconfig table, using the
"key." prefix, and a unique key UUID, i.e.:

The key is used to encrypt subsequent data for a given period of time
(defaults to one day) until a new key is automatically generated.

Here is a sample usage:

[source,java]
-------------
   private void encryptCardData (TLCapture tl, Card card)      <1>
      throws Exception {
        Map<String,String> m = new HashMap<>();
        m.put ("P", card.getPan());
        m.put ("E", card.getExp());
        SecureData sd = getCryptoService().aesEncrypt(         <2>
           Serializer.serializeStringMap(m)
        );
        tl.setKid(sd.getId());                                 <3>
        tl.setSecureData(sd.getEncoded());                     <4>
    }
-------------
<1> TLCapture in this example is a general purpose capture table.
<2> `getCryptoService()` just locates the `CryptoService` using the `NameRegistrar`
<3> `kid` stands for Key ID, we store the key UUID here
<4> `secureData` is a general purpose blob

The crypto service can be configured using a QBean descriptor like this:

[source,xml]
------------
<crypto-service class='org.jpos.crypto.CryptoService' logger='Q2'>
    <property name="custodian" value='demo@jpos.org' />               <1>
    <property name="pubkeyring" value='cfg/keyring.pub' />            <2>
    <property name="privkeyring" value='cfg/keyring.priv' />          <3>
    <property name="lazy" value="false" />                            <4>
    <property name="keylength" value="256" />                         <5>
    <property name="duration" value="86400000" />                     <6>
    <property name="ttl" value="3600000" />                           <7>
    <ks-provider 
    class="org.jpos.crypto.SysConfigCryptoServiceKeyStoreProvider" /> <8>
</crypto-service>
------------
<1> custodian PGP id, there can be many `custodian` entries.
<2> path to the public keyring.
<3> path to the password-protected private keyring.
<4> if lazy=true, a key is generated the first time we call `aesEncrypt`, otherwise, a new one is created at service start.
<5> key length defaults to 256. Can be reduced if AES-256 is not supported by the JVM due to export restrictions.
<6> key duration
<7> internal key cache time-to-live (in millis).
<8> CryptoServiceKeyStoreProvider class configuration.

[TIP]
=====
We currently support two CryptoServiceKeyStoreProvider classes:
`SysConfigCryptoServiceKeyStoreProvider` and `JESpaceCryptoServiceKeyStoreProvider`
=====

This allows jPOS nodes to encrypt data securely without storing the encryption key to disk.

[NOTE]
======
The transient encryption key is still in memory, so core dumps and swap should be
disabled at the operating system level. This approach is still more secure
than obfuscating encryption keys.
======

Decryption -- that can of course run in a different node, at a different time -- requires 
access to the private keyring, with its optional password. Said password can be entered
manually, obtained from a remote service or HSM, etc. and it's a two step process.

First the key has to be _loaded_ into memory, using the `loadKey` method. Once the key
is loaded, the `aesDecrypt` can be called.

These are the method's signatures:

[source,java]
-------------
 public void loadKey (String jobId, String keyId, char[] password) throws Exception;
 public byte[] aesDecrypt (String jobId, String keyId, byte[] encoded) throws Exception;
-------------

Here `keyId`, `password`, and `encoded` cryptogram don't require too much explanation, but `jobId` does
and here is the rationale. We could have a one-shot `aesDecrypt` method accepting the private key password,
but decrypting the AES-256 key using PGP is an expensive operation. In situations
where you have to extract a daily file, probably encrypted by just a handful keys, you don't want to decrypt
the key on every `aesDecrypt` call. We don't want to expose the key to the caller either, so the CryptoService
keeps it in a private field. In order to do that, `loadKey` caches the key (until it's unloaded), so it's
cheap to call `loadKey` followed by `aesDecrypt`, after the first call where the key is actually decrypted,
subsequent calls will be pretty fast.

In order to protect different clients from accessing keys loaded by other ones, we use a `jobId` that can be something as
simple as a `UUID` or any nonce, only known to the caller. That `jobId` can then be used to `unload` those keys, using the
`unloadKey` and `unloadAll` methods:

[source,java]
-------------
    public boolean unloadKey (String jobId, String keyId);
    public void unloadAll(String jobId);
-------------

There's also a no-args `unloadAll()` that unloads all keys, and should be used with care.

For some use cases (i.e. long running crypto-service based micro-service), it is possible to "UNLOCK" the system by calling

[source,java]
-------------
    public boolean unlock (char[] password);
-------------

For completeness, there's also a `lock()` method.

[NOTE]
======
In order to simplify development and testing, and eventually to troubleshoot problems, we've
also created a couple of CLI commands: `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `lock` and `unlock` in the `crypto` CLI subsystem.
======

[TIP]
=====
If you're accessing the CLI using the command line `q2 --cli`, remember that the default `deployDir` is
`deploy-cli` instead of `deploy`. You need a copy (or symlink) of `25_cryptoservice.xml` in that
directory.

If you `ssh` to a running Q2 to reach the CLI, then you can ignore this tip.
=====


For testing purposes, it is possible to set the `unlock-password` property in the
crypto service configuration QBean, i.e.:

[source,xml]
------------
<property name="unlock-password" value="demo" />
------------

[NOTE]
======
This is of course highly insecure, the whole PGP based crypto service scheme makes
no sense at all when unlocking the private key in such a way.
======
