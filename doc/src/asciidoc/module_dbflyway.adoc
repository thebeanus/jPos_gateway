=== FlyWay Support

The `db-flyway` module can be used to run FlyWay migrations from the jPOS command line interface.

It picks the DataSource configuration from the standard DB configuration used by jPOS (that can
be defined in the `db.properties` file, or a target _Environment_.

When running `q2 --cli` (or reaching a running Q2 server using SSH), there's a
new `flyway` subsystem. Inside the `flyway` subsystem you can find the following
commands:

- `clean`
- `info`
- `baseline`
- `migrate`
- `validate`
- `repair`

All Flyway commands take into account possible environment variables, defined in `cfg/default.yml`, i.e.:

[source,yaml]
-------------
flyway:
    table: schema_version <1>
-------------
<1> Sets `flyway.table` property, in this example, we override the new default value `flyway_schema_history` for
    backward compatibility.

[NOTE]
======
By default, the `clean` command is disabled, unless `flyway.cleanDisabled: false` is placed in the environment.
======

[TIP]
=====
The migrate command accepts an optional --out-of-order parameter.
=====

In addition to CLI support, there's also a `FlywayService` that can be
configured as a QBean. We recommend to use a low filename (such as
`01_flyway.xml`) so that the service starts before other services that may
require the schema to be impacted in the database.

The QBean descriptor looks like this:

[source,xml]
------------
<flyway class="org.jpos.flyway.FlywayService" logger="Q2">
    <property name="out-of-order" value="true" />                   <1>
    <commands>
        info
        migrate
    </commands>
</flyway>
------------
<1> Optional property used by Flyway migrate.


Valid commands are:

- info
- baseline
- repair
- migrate
- validate
- clean

[NOTE]
======
For security, the `clean` command is disabled by default. The
`flyway.cleanDisabled` property can be set to `false` in order to enable it.
======

[TIP]
======
These Flyway commands use stdout for their output. We recommend to add
<property name="redirect" value="stdout, stderr" />
to your 00_logger.xml configuration in order to get unified logs.
